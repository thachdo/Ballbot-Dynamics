## Ballbot Dynamics
The following matlab files are ballbot dynamics presented in my published papers.
1. **2D Dynamics (Planar Dynamics)**: (f2D_dynamics.m) Dynamics of the ballbot in a two-dimensional plane.

>Paper: [Robust integral backstepping hierarchical sliding mode controller for a ballbot system](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.106866)
2. **Coupled 2D Dynamics**: (to be updated) Coupled dynamics of vertical planes, while separating the horizontal plane.

>Paper: [Neural Integral Backstepping Hierarchical Sliding Mode Control for a Ridable Ballbot Under Uncertainties and Input Saturation](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2020.2967433)
3. **Full 3D Dynamics**: (full3D_dynamics.m) Full three-dimensional dynamics of the ballbot.
